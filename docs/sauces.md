### Vinaigrette

*At its simplest, vinaigrette is a mixture of vinegar and oil in a ratio of 1 part vinegar to about 3 or 4 parts oil.* - Alice Waters

* 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
* Salt
* Freshly ground black pepper

  Stir to dissolve, taste and adjust

* 3 to 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

  Taste as you go

  **Why make vinaigrette when you can just buy?**

 1. Good vinaigrette is essentially good quality vinegar and good quality oil, which if bought separately, can be used for various other things.  Good excuse to try out different types of vinegar and oils out there, & experiment!

 2. Once you get the hang of it, it makes the store-bought vinaigrette not worth the money.
