**Tips:**

1. Try different varieties of bananas for different subtlety of flavors.  

2. Sugar should be adjusted according to the sweetness of the bananas.

3. Personally, I will avoid 'pretty' bananas like Del Monte, and go for the less pretty ones from Malaysia/Indonesia, such as *pisang berangan*.  

4. Don't hesitate to use **extremely ripe bananas**.  'Bananas going bad' give you the strongest *banana* flavor.
