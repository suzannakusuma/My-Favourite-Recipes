### About me

I am a novice cook who likes to eat a good meal that is not produced or derived harmfully.  

Notably, it is a big challenge once one tries to establish certain boundaries, but I'm learning along the way!    

The rules which I try to follow:

* Know where my food comes from, where and how it is grown
* Strive to make food that tastes good, else why bother
* It is a myth that healthy food doesn't taste good
* Less is more   


My inspiration:

*Eat seasonally.
Eat locally and sustainably.
Shop at farmerâ€™s markets.
Plant a garden.
Conserve, compost and recycle.
Cook simply, engaging all your senses.
Set the table with care and respect.
Eat together.
Food is precious.*
